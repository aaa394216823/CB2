\title{Extract real cell matrix from \code{CBFindCell} output}
\usage{
GetCellMat(CBout, MTfilter = 1, MTgene = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{CBout}{Output object from \code{CBFindCell}.}

\item{MTfilter}{Numeric value between 0 to 1. Default: \code{1} (No filtering). Mitochondrial gene expression proportion filtering threshold for broken cells. The proportion of mitochondrial gene
expressions is calculated from the scaled sum of all genes starting with "MT-" (human) or "mt-" (mouse).}

\item{MTgene}{Character vector. User may specify customized mitochondrial gene IDs to perform the filtering.}
}
\description{
Handy function to extract real cell matrix from \code{CBFindCell} output. It also provides
the option to filter out broken cells based on proportion of mitochondrial gene expressions.

\examples{
data(mbrainSub)
CBOut <- CBFindCell(mbrainSub, FDR_threshold = 0.01, pooling_threshold = 100, Ncores = 4)
RealCell <- GetCellMat(CBOut, MTfilter = 0.05)
str(RealCell)
